/**
 * Most things in Nimbus occurs within a scope. An event, for instance, can be triggered in the scope of button click,
 * which is in the scope of a component (node).
 *
 * The scope allows us to recover important information about the event, component, view and even access objects stored
 * in the Nimbus Scope, like the logger and the HttpClient.
 *
 * The Scope is nothing more than a tree, if we don't find what we're looking for in the current scope, we look into
 * the parent scope, until we get to the root.
 *
 * Normally, but not necessarily, a Scope tree will follow a format like this: Nimbus > View > RootNode > Node A >
 * Node B > Event A > Event B.
 *
 * A Scope is also responsible for holding states, which can be set by the operation `setState` and read by expressions.
 * Global states will be in `Nimbus`, states specific to a view in `ServerDrivenView` and local states in their
 * respective nodes.
 *
 * A Scope can also work as a storage unit through its methods get and set. This is useful for registering dependencies
 * in the UI Layer.
