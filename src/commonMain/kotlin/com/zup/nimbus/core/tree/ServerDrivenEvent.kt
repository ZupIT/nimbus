/**
 * ServerDrivenEvents represent a list of actions in the original json.
 *
 * A ServerDrivenEvent is a scope that always create a state with the same name as the key of the property who had the
 * list of actions as its value. The value of this state can be changed through the method run(Any?).
 *
 * Example: the onChange event of a TextInput will create the state "onChange" with null as its initial value. When the
 * user types in the text input created in the UI Layer, it must call run with the new value of the input, making the
 * information available for every action within this event through the state "onChange".
 *
 * Since the event always create a state, it is possible that an event overwrites another state. For instance, if
 * you have a root state called "onPress" and a button component with an event with the same name, the root state
 * "onPress" won't be accessible from within the actions of the event. Renaming the root state would solve this issue.
