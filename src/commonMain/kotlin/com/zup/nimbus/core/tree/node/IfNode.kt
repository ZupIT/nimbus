// fixme: normally, in UI frameworks, if-else blocks completely remove the other branch from the tree and rebuilds it
//  when the condition changes. This is not being done here. On the positive side, states will never be lost when
//  switching from true to false. On the other hand, we won't free up the memory for the if-else branch not currently
//  rendered until the associated RootNode is unmounted. If we decide this to be a feature and not a bug, remove this
//  commentary.
