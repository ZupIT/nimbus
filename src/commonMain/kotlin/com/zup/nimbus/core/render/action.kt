/**
 * Deserializes a list of ServerDrivenAction into a function.
 *
 * @param actionList the list of actions to parse into a function.
 * @param event name of the event that triggers the actionList, i.e. the key of the map entry. This will act as the id
 * of the implicit state (if any).
 * @param node the node that declared the actionList.
 * @param view the view holding the node.
 * @param extraStates states that should be accounted even though they are not part of the node's state hierarchy. Use
 * this to deal with implicit states. The extra states must be in descending order of priority and they all have higher
 * priority than `node.stateHierarchy`. This is used when both the parent action and sub action declare implicit
 * states).
 * @param resolve a function to parse all sub-actions and expressions.
