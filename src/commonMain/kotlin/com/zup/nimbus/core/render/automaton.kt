/**
 * Creates a Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPA) according to states and transitions passed as
 * parameters.
 *
 * A DPA is often used to recognize patterns in a string. Although regular expressions also
 * recognizes patterns in strings, a DPA is more powerful and can recognize more complex structures.
 * A regular expression can only recognize regular languages, while a DPA can also recognize
 * free context languages.
 *
 * This function creates an automaton with a single function: `match`. `match` is always run for
 * a string and, if a match is found, the string matching the pattern is returned. If no match is
 * found, `null` is returned.
 *
 * Every time `match` is called, the automaton starts at the state `param.initial` and if it ever
 * reaches `param.final`, it stops with a match. If the input ends and the current automaton state
 * is not the final, there's no match. Also, if there's no transition for the current input, the
 * automaton stops without a match.
 *
 * To represent end of stack, use the constant `Automaton.empty`.
 *
 * Note about reading an input: to make the representation easier, we can read multiple characters
 * at once from the input. This means that, in a state transition, `read` can be something like
 * `An entire paragraph.`, instead of sequence of transitions for each letter. Moreover, to simplify
 * the state machine, we can also use a regular expression in the property `read` of the transition.
 *
