     * Creates a Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPA) according to states and transitions passed as
     * parameters.
     *
     * A DPA is oftenly used to recognize patterns in a string. Although regular expressions also
     * recognizes patterns in strings, a DPA is more powerful and can recognize more complex structures.
     * A regular expression can only recognize regular languages, while a DPA can also recognize
     * free context languages.
     *
     * This function creates an automaton with a single function: `match`. `match` is always run for
     * a string and, if a match is found, the string matching the pattern is returned. If no match is
     * found, `null` is returned.
     *
     * Every time `match` is called, the automaton starts at the state `param.initial` and if it ever
     * reaches `param.final`, it stops with a match. If the input ends and the current automaton state
     * is not the final, there's no match. Also, if there's no transition for the current input, the
     * automaton stops without a match.
     *
     * To represent end of stack, use the constant `Automaton.empty`.
     *
     * Note about reading an input: to make the representation easier, we can read multiple characters
     * at once from the input. This means that, in a state transition, `read` can be something like
     * `An entire paragraph.`, instead of sequence of transitions for each letter. Moreover, to simplify
     * the state machine, we can also use a regular expression in the property `read` of the transition.
     *
     * @param params an object with the initial state (string), final state (string) and the state
     * transitions. The state transitions are a map where the key is the state and the value is an array
     * of transitions for the state. A transition is composed by `read` (the string or regex to read
     * from the input string); `push` (the value to push to the stack); `pop` (the value to pop from
     * the stack); and `next` (the next state). The only required property for a transition is `next`.
